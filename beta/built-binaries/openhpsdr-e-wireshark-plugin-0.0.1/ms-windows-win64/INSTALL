-- Open the Wireshark GUI.
-- Goto the Help Menu.
-- Open the "About Wireshark Menu".
-- Click on the Plugins tab.
-- Look and see where the other plugins are located.
-- When I installed the Wireshark via the installer, Wireshark was
-- expecting the plug-ins in the the directory:
-- C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\<version>\
--
-- copy the file: openhpsdr.dll
-- to wherever Wireshark is looking for plug-ins.
--

--Open the Wireshark GUI.

-- Open the "About Wireshark Menu".
-- Click on the Plugins tab.
