     -- Removed the non-existing 8th open collector.
     -- Moved CWX0 into a sub menu.
     -- changed fields:
        openhpsdr-e.hpc.cwx0    is now openhpsdr-e.hpc.cwx0-cwx
        openhpsdr-e.hpc.cw-dot  is now openhpsdr-e.hpc.cwx0-dot
        openhpsdr-e.hpc.cw-dash is now openhpsdr-e.hpc.cwx0-dash
 - Fixed incorrect multiple use of the same field:
  -- openhpsdr-e.cr.discovery.mac
    --- Added fields:
        openhpsdr-e.cr.erase.mac
        openhpsdr-e.cr.program.mac
  -- openhpsdr-e.cr.discovery.board

    Command Reply (CR):
      - Added to Discovery reply
    High Priority Status (HP):
      - Change label for bits 0 to 4 of byte 59.
    High Priority Command (HPC):
       -Added text string listing Alex0 register map bits not used by
        Orion MkII (ANAN-8000DLE).
       -Added Alex0 TX RX Orion MkII (ANAN-8000DLE) status bit.

Version 0.0.5:
  - Wireshark version 2.2.3
  - Changed the number of audio samples from 360 to 64 for DDCA and from 720
    to 64 for MICL.
  - The plug-in should be up to date with the 3.2 version of the Protocol
    Document.

Version 0.0.4:
